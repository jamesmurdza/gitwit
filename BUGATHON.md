# GitWit Bugathon

GitWit is hosting a bugathon from **November 3-10, 2025**. The users who report the most bugs via this GitHub repository will win prizes. More information and updates will be provided via the `#bugathon` channel [on Discord](https://discord.gitwit.dev/).

1. The first user to report the bug through GitHub is awarded recognition. (The early bird gets the bug!)
2. All bugs must relate to this repository, which you may test with [our cloud version](https://sandbox.gitwit.dev/) or locally.
3. Bugs should fill out the required fields in the [GitWit issue](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/gitwit/issues) template.
4. We will mark all similar bugs as duplicate, and close non-bugs. Duplicate or closed issues are not recognized.
5. If you’re not sure if something is a bug, create an issue!
6. The hackathon will officially end on **Monday, November 10 at 10am PT**.
7. The first prize will be **$200** and the second prize will be **$100**.
8. Winners will be announced within 48 hours and prizes will be sent promptly.
