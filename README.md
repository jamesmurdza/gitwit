Sandbox is an open-source cloud-based code editing environment with custom AI code generation, live preview, real-time collaboration, and AI chat.

For the latest updates, join our Discord server: [discord.gitwit.dev](https://discord.gitwit.dev/).

## Running Locally

### 0. Requirements

The application uses NodeJS for the backend, NextJS for the frontend, and Cloudflare workers for additional backend tasks.

Needed accounts to set up:

- [Clerk](https://clerk.com/): Used for user authentication.
- [E2B](https://e2b.dev/): Used for the terminals and live preview.
- [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com/) or AWS Bedrock: API keys for code generation.
- [OpenAI](https://openai.com/): API keys for applying AI-generated code diffs.

A quick overview of the tech before we start: The deployment uses a **NextJS** app for the frontend and an **ExpressJS** server on the backend. Presumably that's because NextJS integrates well with Clerk middleware but not with Socket.io.

### 1. Initial setup

No surprise in the first step:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jamesmurdza/sandbox
cd sandbox
```

Run `npm install` in:

```
/frontend
/backend/server
```

### 2. Adding Clerk

Setup the Clerk account.
Get the API keys from Clerk.

Update `/frontend/.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY='ðŸ”‘'
CLERK_SECRET_KEY='ðŸ”‘'
```

### 4. Deploying the database

Create a database:

```
psql postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE sandbox;"
```

Update `backend/server/.env` with the database connection string.

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/sandbox
```

Follow this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w5dA5daic_sIYB5Seni1KvnFx51pPV2so6lLdN2xa7Q/edit?usp=sharing) for more info.

### 5. Applying the database schema

Delete the `/backend/server/drizzle/meta` directory.

In the `/backend/server/` directory:

```
npm run generate
npm run migrate
```

### 6. Adding E2B

Setup the E2B account.

Update `/backend/server/.env`:

```
E2B_API_KEY='ðŸ”‘'
```

### 7. Configuring the frontend

Update `/frontend/.env`:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL='http://localhost:4000'
```

Then add EITHER Anthropic direct API key:
```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='ðŸ”‘'
```

OR AWS Bedrock configuration (if using Claude through AWS as described in the [Setting Up Your AWS Bedrock Keys](#setting-up-your-aws-bedrock-keys) section):
```
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID='ðŸ”‘'
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY='ðŸ”‘'
AWS_REGION='your_aws_region'
AWS_ARN='arn:aws:bedrock:...'
```

Finally, add OpenAI API key for code diffs:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY='ðŸ”‘'
```

### 8. Running the IDE

Run `npm run dev` simultaneously in:

```
/frontend
/backend/server
```

## Setting Up Your AWS Bedrock Keys

To use the `anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0` model via Amazon Bedrock, follow these steps:

1. **Create an AWS Account** (if you don't have one)
   - Go to [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com/) and sign up for an AWS account.

2. **Create an IAM User with Programmatic Access**
   - Navigate to IAM in the AWS Management Console.
   - Click "Users" â†’ "Add users".
   - Enter a username and select "Programmatic access".
   - Attach permissions for Amazon Bedrock:
     ```json
     {
       "Version": "2012-10-17", 
       "Statement": [
         {
           "Effect": "Allow",
           "Action": [
             "bedrock:*",
             "kms:GenerateDataKey",
             "kms:Decrypt"  
           ],
           "Resource": "*"
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
   - Complete the process and save your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.

3. **Enable Model Access in Bedrock**
   - Go to Amazon Bedrock in the AWS Console.
   - Navigate to "Model access" and request access to Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
   - Wait for approval (usually immediate).
   - Note: Ensure you're in a supported region. Claude 3.7 Sonnet is available in regions like `us-east-1` (N. Virginia), `us-west-2` (Oregon), and others.

4. **Create a Provisioned Throughput**
   - In Bedrock, go to "Inference and Assessment" â†’ "Provisioned Throughput".
   - Create a new inference profile for Claude 3.7 Sonnet.
   - Select the model ID: `anthropic.claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219-v1:0`
   - Choose your desired throughput capacity.
   - Copy the ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of your inference profile.

5. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Add the following to your `.env` file:
     ```
     AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
     AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
     AWS_REGION=your_aws_region
     AWS_ARN=your_inference_profile_arn
     ```

6. **Verify Setup**
   - After configuring the environment variables, restart your application.
   - Test the connection by sending a simple prompt to the model.
   - If you encounter issues, check the AWS CloudWatch logs for error messages.

**Note:** Using AWS Bedrock incurs costs based on your usage and provisioned throughput. Review the [AWS Bedrock pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/pricing/) before setting up.

## Setting up Deployments

The steps above do not include steps to setup [Dokku](https://github.com/dokku/dokku), which is required for deployments.

**Note:** This is completely optional to set up if you just want to run GitWit Sandbox.

Setting up deployments first requires a separate domain (such as gitwit.app, which we use).

We then deploy Dokku on a separate server, according to this guide: https://dev.to/jamesmurdza/host-your-own-paas-platform-as-a-service-on-amazon-web-services-3f0d

And we install [dokku-daemon](https://github.com/dokku/dokku-daemon) with the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/dokku/dokku-daemon
cd dokku-daemon
sudo make install
systemctl start dokku-daemon
```

The Sandbox platform connects to the Dokku server via SSH, using SSH keys specifically generated for this connection. The SSH key is stored on the Sandbox server, and the following environment variables are set in /backend/server/.env:

```bash
DOKKU_HOST=
DOKKU_USERNAME=
DOKKU_KEY=
```

## Deploying to AWS

The backend server and deployments server can be deployed using AWS's EC2 service. See [our video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WN8HQnimjmk) on how to do this.

## connecting to your GitHub account
You can connect your GitHub account to GitWit by following these steps:
1. Go to ``` https://github.com/settings/developers ``` and create a new OAuth App.
2. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to ``` http://localhost:3000/loading ``` if you running locally
3. Set the "Homepage URL" to ``` http://localhost:3000 ``` if you running locally
4. Get the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" from the OAuth App.
4. Set the "Client ID" and "Client Secret" in the ``` /backend/server/.env ``` file.


## Creating Custom Templates

Anyone can contribute a custom template for integration in Sandbox. Since Sandbox is built on E2B, there is no limitation to what langauge or runtime a Sandbox can use.

Currently there are five templates:

- [jamesmurdza/dokku-reactjs-template](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/dokku-reactjs-template)
- [jamesmurdza/dokku-vanillajs-template](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/dokku-vanillajs-template)
- [jamesmurdza/dokku-nextjs-template](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/dokku-nextjs-template)
- [jamesmurdza/dokku-streamlit-template](https://github.com/jamesmurdza/dokku-streamlit-template)
- [omarrwd/dokku-php-template](https://github.com/omarrwd/dokku-php-template)

To create your own template, you can fork one of the above templates or start with a new blank repository. The template should have at least an `e2b.Dockerfile`, which is used by E2B to create the development environment. Optionally, a `Dockerfile` can be added which will be used to create the project build when it is deployed.

To test the template, you must have an [E2B account](https://e2b.dev/) and the [E2B CLI tools](https://e2b.dev/docs/cli) installed. Then, in the Terminal, run:

```
e2b auth login
```

Then, navigate to your template directory and run the following command where **TEMPLATENAME** is the name of your template:

```
e2b template build -d e2b.Dockerfile -n TEMPLATENAME
```

Finally, to test your template run:

```
e2b sandbox spawn TEMPLATENAME
cd project
```

You will see a URL in the form of `https://xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.e2b-staging.com`.

Now, run the command to start your development server.

To see the running server, visit the public url `https://<PORT>-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx.e2b-staging.com`.

If you've done this and it works, let us know and we'll add your template to Sandbox! Please reach out to us [on Discord](https://discord.gitwit.dev/) with any questions or to submit your working template.

Note: In the future, we will add a way to specify the command triggered by the "Run" button (e.g. "npm run dev").
